## My process

1. Recreated the design as per [Figma]()

2. Started with the mockup -- deleteting unrequired files and adding the `component` and `images` files to the structure after `npm create vite@latest Quizzical -- --template react`

3. Writing out this `README.md` file

### Built with

- React
- JSX syntax
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid

### What I learned

- Using Figma files to code

- js  React := 
- ##### ES6 Function call VS Normal fxn call

```JSX

```
-css/ HTML :=
- ##### Styling an element conditionally

```css

```

- ##### React! React! React!

### Continued development

- Learning more React! (yeah reenacting React problems and tackling them)

- Better turnaround time -- simple stuff but worked on it for a while

- Less Code (code cleanup)
